Provide instructions on how to compile and run your code, especially if you used a nonstandard Makefile, or you are one of those hackers who insists on doing things differently.

I built my project by openning the asst1.vcxproj file and building asst1.cpp from there.

Indicate if you met all problem set requirements (more importantly, let us know where your bugs are and what you did to try to eliminate the bugs; we want to give you as much partial credit as we can).

I believe I implemented all of the functionalioty present in the original solution demo. 
My version includes: no stretching, proper scaling if the window gets too small, rendering both a quad and a tri, both have proper UVs, both have movement (I implemented the j,i,k,l movement for the tri), and lastly the tri has both the shield texture, as well as the gradient based on aPosition.

Provide some overview of the code design. Don't go into details; just give us the big picture.

I stuck to the structure provided in the base code. Perhaps it may have been better if I had abstracted some logic, but instead, for now, in order to learn the entire process, I just replicated the same code again for the triangle. This is not good coding practice, but it seemed like a good way to learn all the steps.

Let us know how to run the program; what are the hot keys, mouse button usage, and so on? Describe steps or sequences of steps the TF should take to test and evaluate your code (especially if your implmenentation strays from the assignment specification).

All of the controls are exactly the same as in the sollution exe provided. You can also get the control scheme by pressing h when the applicaiton is running.

Finally, did you implement anything above and beyond the problem set? If so, document it in order for the TFs to test it and evaluate it.

I did not.
